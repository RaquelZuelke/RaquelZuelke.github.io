                <br>History of Programming Languages <br/>
                <p> There are about more than 500 programming languages and the number still continues to grow!
                    The start of programming language goes all the way back to the 1800s. 
                    There can be multiply ways we can communicate with out computer so we 
                    were introduced to the first languages of programming. A few of the earlier languages that
                    were presented were COBOL and FORTRAN. The first languages were the low-level languages.</p>
